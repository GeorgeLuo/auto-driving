# M007 CLI journey coverage evidence

This directory owns the canonical `m007_cli_journey_coverage_v1` report for the
accepted primary CLI journey and the three required continuity families.

The report is generated only through the reviewed
[`coverage_session`](../../tools/cli-journey-coverage/README.md) procedure from
a clean implementation revision and a recorded clean Metrics UI revision. Raw
Coverage.py databases, process shards, temporary configs, and local session
paths remain in the untracked session root.

Acceptance requires `report.json` to contain `result: pass`, a valid canonical
self-digest, complete collection-bound foreground/background process receipts,
successful cleanup, and current source and dependency identities.

This evidence reports executed owned-Python statements and arcs. It makes no
claim of behavioral correctness, dead code, production value, or a sufficient
numeric coverage threshold; PRs #88 and #100 remain the behavioral authority.

The final implementation PR records the collection ID, subject and Metrics UI
commits, dependency/interpreter identity, report digest, command/context/shard
counts, worker-only proof, cleanup result, immutable receipt hashes, and proof
that repository-root `.coverage*` identities were unchanged.
